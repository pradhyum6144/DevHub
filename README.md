# DevHub

A modern developer platform inspired by GitHub’s simplicity and power. Built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.
You can check if it's installed by running:

3.  **Run the Development Server**:

    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **View the App**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
